There's a lot of noise around x402 rn. Let me make it very simple for you:

x402 is an open web standard that lets people monetize APIs easily.

It supercharges APIs.

Traditionally, you have to sign up on an API platform, set up your credit card, get an API token and then use that token to access paid API endpoints.

You have to repeat this process for every single API platform. It sucks.

It sucks for the customer, and it sucks for the vendors too. There is too much setup involved.

Selling services on internet shouldn't be so hard.

With x402, this setup cost goes down to practically zero for both parties. All you need is a wallet address.

With x402, when you try to access a paid API endpoint, the endpoint sends back instructions to your browser/server in order for you to be able to complete the required payment.

No need to sign up for Stripe, Gumroad, or setup custom API billing. 

The same open standard works for everyone, everywhere - across vendors and chains.

It just works.

Naturally, this infra is very well-suited for AI agents. More on that later!
